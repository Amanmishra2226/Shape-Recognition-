# Shape-Recognition-
🧠 Shape Recognition using Python  This project focuses on recognizing and classifying basic geometric shapes such as circle, triangle, square, rectangle, and polygon from images using OpenCV and contour detection techniques.

🔍 Features
Detects and labels shapes from images or real-time webcam feed
Uses contour approximation and edge detection (Canny)
Supports multiple shapes with high accuracy
Easy to use and modify for custom datasets

⚙️ Technologies Used
Python 🐍
OpenCV (cv2)
NumPy

🚀 How It Works
The input image is converted to grayscale and thresholded.
Contours are detected using OpenCV.
Each contour is approximated and classified based on the number of edges.
The recognized shape is displayed on the output image.

🧩 Future Improvements
Integrate deep learning for complex shape detection
Add GUI for better user interaction
Include real-time shape recognition using webcam
